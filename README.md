# Visualization repository for [stm32h745-ipc](https://github.com/kovacsdotgergo/stm32h745-ipc)

The Python scripts can be executed after installing the packages in `requirements.txt`.

* Measurements can be recorded using the `measurements.py` file after downloading the microcontroller code.
* The results can be observed by configuring and running the `visu.py`, `histogram.py` and `visu3d.py` files.
* Fitting of the linear model was performed using `model_regression.py`.
* The final figures were rendered by running `final_visu.py`.

The measurement files are available in a release.
